COVAIR- Study of Air Quality during Covid.
The purpose of this study is to compare data on Covid-19 cases and air quality in different regions of the planet in 2020 to find if there is any correlation between the two.It also compares the 2019 air quality data to 2020 data and run Standard T-test on the 2 datasets.

We are using Python script to visualize the air quality and the number of covid cases.
Creating  a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:
Air Quality(PM 2.5) vs. Covid Cases
Air Quality(CO) vs. Covid Cases
Air Quality(NO2) vs. Covid Cases
After each plot add a sentence or too explaining what the code is and analyzing.
We also run linear regression on each relationship.

Summary
AIR QUALITY for COUNTRIES (US, JP, IT, SP, GR, NZ, BR, IN, NZ)
Based on P values,
	1)  PM25 improvements were observed in JP, IT, NZ, GR, SP, BR & IN
	2)  CO improvements were observed in IT, SP, BR, IN, NZ &US
	3)  NO2 improvements were observed in IT, SP, BR, IN, US, GR & JP

CONCLUSIONS:  
Shutdowns across the globe had an effect on the Air Quality parameters.
Data indicates that reduced industrial activity and vehicle emissions helped improve air quality parameters.
City data from Boston and Chicago show that during the shut down period( resulting in reduced vehicular emissions and industrial activity) shows an improvement in Air Quality parameters, when compared to 2019.

 COVID CASES vs AIR QUALITY for COUNTRIES 
Based on correlation values,
	1)  PM25 â€“ strong to moderate negative correlation observed in IT, SP, BR & IN
	2)  CO - strong to moderate negative correlation in JP, IT, SP, BR & IN
	3)  NO2-  strong to moderate negative correlation in IT, SP, BR, IN, US,  & JP

CONCLUSIONS:  
Countries with high COVID cases show a relationship with improved Air Quality parameters
The negative correlation indicates that the rise in Covid cases (X variable) resulted in the reduced air Quality parameters (Y variable).
The US is an outlier among countries as all parts of the country did not completely shutdown thus showing air quality improvements in only certain cities ( Boston, Chicago).
